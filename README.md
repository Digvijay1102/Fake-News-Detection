📰 Fake News Detection Model
This project is a machine learning model that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based architectures like BERT and RoBERTa. With the rise of misinformation on digital platforms, this model aims to provide an automated way to detect and reduce the spread of fake news.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing of news datasets (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
Transformer-based models for contextual text understanding.
Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Trained on publicly available fake news datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Transformers (Hugging Face)
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

📊 Results
The model achieves strong performance in distinguishing between fake and real news, showing the effectiveness of transformer-based approaches in text classification tasks.

🎯 Goal
To build a reliable tool that helps identify misinformation and contributes to a trustworthy information ecosystem.
